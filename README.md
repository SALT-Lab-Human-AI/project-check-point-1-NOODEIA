## üÜò Problem Statement and Why It Matters

American education is in trouble. When [less than half of kids can read at grade level,](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/DashViewReportSB?ps=true&lstTestYear=2024&lstTestType=B&lstGroup=1&lstSubGroup=1&lstSchoolType=A&lstGrade=13&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000&lstSchool=0000000) and even fewer can handle basic math, we have a serious problem. It's not just about test scores either. As a nation, there are over 400,000 teaching positions [either unfulfilled or employing teachers without full certifications.](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/state-teacher-shortages-vacancy-resource-tool-2024)

Although places like [Two By Two Learning Center](https://www.twobytwolearningcenters.com) are doing incredible work to support kids after school, [over 60%](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/spp/results.asp) of public schools nationally offer academically focused after-school programming. Kids are falling further behind, tutors are burning out, and everyone is frustrated. We desperately need tools that can exemplify the impact of the educators and help kids learn.

## üéØ Target Users and Core Tasks

Our tool needs to work for four very different stakeholders, each with their own challenges. 

* **Middle school students** are old enough to use technology but still need guidance. They're mainly looking for homework help and confidence boosters, which an AI tutor can provide. 

* **High school students** are generally more knowledgeable than their younger peers, being able to ask more complex questions. An AI tutor for this student group will need to be engaging, responsive, and comprehensive. 

**Parents** pay for their child's education, even though it's possible that their children are cheating with AI. Parents want to see real progress and results, understand what their kids are learning, and be shown how an AI tool is actually helping their kid, rather than doing the student's work for them. 

**After-school staff** have a lot on their plate. They need a tool that will help efficiency and simplify their jobs. An AI tutoring tool should help staff track individual student progress, communicate with parents, and give in-depth reports of what was learned each session. An AI may even be able to help create practice lessons and/or quizzes.

| üë• **User** | üèÜ **Primary Goal** | üîß **What We Provide** |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Middle schoolers** | Homework help, improving confidence | Socratic hints and Streak bonuses |
| **High schoolers** | Engaging learning | Challenge modes with boss battles |
| **Parents** | Demonstrate real progress | Weekly achievement reports |
| **Afterschool staff** | Easier tutoring & tracking | Dashboards and auto-grading |

## üèÅ Competitive Landscape and AI Limitations

NotebookLM is a tool by Google to be used by students for help with homework. It can take images as inputs, and answer user questions similar to other LLMs. Our findings show that NotebookLM explains answers, but does not do a great job providing reasoning, intuition, and explaining *how* to solve a problem to a student who doesn‚Äôt get it. NotebookLM also has an audio podcast feature, which only uses the image input to generate an audio description of said image. The audio feature did not use conversational context to help the user.

GPT-5 is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It has a high number of users, and can answer questions in many domains. GPT-5 output extra noise during our testing, which can be confusing to younger users who don‚Äôt understand complex sentences. GPT-5 also was on the slower side, often taking a couple seconds to properly run after being prompted.

Copilot did a better job matching our instructions, but sometimes gave answers that were too simple or didn‚Äôt explain its thinking enough. However, Copilot is also integrated into GitHub and Microsoft Office, giving it a broader knowledge base. That may make it too complex for users who only want a chatbot.

 Perplexity solved most problems correctly, but assumed certain parts about the user‚Äôs background knowledge in its answers. This sometimes led to answers being made more complicated than necessary. There were also lots of links given which adds noise and may distract students.

## üìö Literature Review

### Qiran Hu

[AI-Powered Math Tutoring Platform Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)

Chudziak, J. A., & Kostka, A. (2025). AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education. arXiv [Cs.AI]. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484

- This research addresses a critical gap in current AI tutoring systems where the AI systems tend to provide direct answers rather than showing step by step solutions. With dual memory architecture, this sophisticated approach provides both strategically informed guidance based on historical patterns and detailed responsive support based on context.

- By implementing a hybrid memory architecture, the knowledge graph could serve as the long term memory component where each concept node has specific attributes such as historical error patterns and identified misconceptions. Since graph relationships naturally represents prerequisite chains and conceptual dependencies, this enables sophisticated reasoning about learning paths.

[MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560)

Packer, C., Wooders, S., Lin, K., Fang, V., Patil, S. G., Stoica, I., & Gonzalez, J. E. (2024). MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems. arXiv [Cs.AI]. Retrieved from¬†http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560

- The paper tackles LLMs‚Äô short memory by adding an OS-style, tiered memory: a small main context (system rules, working pad, FIFO queue) plus external recall and archival stores, managed by a queue manager and function executor that move/condense information via function calls and summaries.

- Use Archival as a compact student profile while keeping full transcripts in Recall; have the tutor auto-summarize to Archival when memory pressure warnings appear and reload from these notes at the start of each session.

[Generative AI Can Harm Learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4895486)

Bastani, Hamsa and Bastani, Osbert and Sungu, Alp and Ge, Haosen and Kabakcƒ±, √ñzge and Mariman, Rei, Generative AI Can Harm Learning (July 15, 2024). The Wharton School Research Paper. http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4895486 

- Researchers who put an AI, an AI tutor with special prompts, and no AIs into three math classrooms and compared test results to each other. 

- The results show students learned much better with a tutor who guides them instead of giving the answers, but students without a special AI tutor performed the same on standardized tests than ones with the specialized tutor. We will make sure that our AI tutor does not give answers away as that seems to make students use the AI as a crutch and perform worse overall.

### Rosie Xu

[Agentic Workflow for Education: Concepts and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01517)

Jiang, Y.-H., Lu, Y., Dai, L., Wang, J., Li, R., & Jiang, B. (2025). Agentic Workflow for Education: Concepts and Applications. arXiv [Cs.CY]. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01517

- The paper redefines agentic AI as something beyond simple Q&A interactions. It is a fundamental shift to a nonlinear cooperative systems where agents plan, use tools, and self-critique.

- By adopting this multi-agent with division of labor, we aim to implement a muti-agent system for problem solving, question writing, and explanation generation and we hope to achieve an increase in accuracy and explanation quality.

## üöÄ Initial Concept and Value Proposition

### Core Concept Overview

The personalized AI tutor represents a fundamental reimagining of educational technology through the integration of orchestrated multi-agent systems with memory-enhanced graph retrieval augmented generation . This system transcends traditional digital learning tools by creating an adaptive educational companion that maintains persistent awareness of individual learning patterns, dynamically adjusts teaching strategies based on accumulated experience, and delivers consistently high-quality educational support across diverse subject domains. The platform operates as an intelligent educational ecosystem rather than a static question-answering service, fundamentally transforming how students engage with complex learning materials.

### Primary Value Proposition

The primary value proposition emerges from the system's ability to provide genuinely personalized education at scale and maintaining the pedagogical sophistication typically associated with expert human tutors. Unlike conventional educational software that delivers uniform content regardless of individual needs, this system creates unique learning pathways for each student based on their specific knowledge gaps. Through its sophisticated memory architecture and continuous adaptation mechanisms, the platform delivers educational experiences that evolve with each student's progress, creating compound improvements in learning efficiency over time. This translates directly into reduced time-to-mastery for complex subjects and improved retention rates for learned material.

### Proposed Muti-Agent Workflow

This is our proposed muti-agent workflow

<img width = "850px" alt = "Proposed workflow" src = "./docs/architecture/architecture.png">

#### Workflow Overview

This enhanced muti-agent workflow provides several advantages over simpler tutoring systems. The multi-agent approach allows for specialized agent to assist students with specific needs. The memory system enables personalized responses that fit into individual learning patterns. The comprehensive evaluation framework ensures high quality outputs, which significantly reduces the hallucinations. With the integration of structured knowledge graphs, this muti-agent workflow creates a personalized AI tutoring platform.

### Proposed MEGRAG Architecture

**M**emory
**E**nhanced
**G**raph
**R**etrieval
**A**ugmented
**G**eneration

This is our proposed MEGRAG architecture

$$\boxed{\mathrm{Score_{memory}} = S(1 - r_{\mathrm{semantic}})^{t_{\mathrm{semantic}}} + E(1 - r_{\mathrm{episodic}})^{t_{\mathrm{episodic}}} + P(1 - r_{\mathrm{procedural}})^{t_{\mathrm{procedural}}}}$$

where $S$ is the semantic memory, $r_{\text{semantic}}$ is the decay rate for semantic memory, $t_{\text{semantic}}$ is the hours passed since the semantic memory in the retriever was last accessed rather than created, $E$ is the episodic memory, $r_{\text{episodic}}$ is the decay rate for episodic memory, $t_{\text{episodic}}$ is the hours passed since the episodic memory in the retriever was last accessed rather than created, $P$ is procedural memory, $r_{\text{procedural}}$ is the decay rate for procedural memory, and $t_{\text{procedural}}$ is the hours passed since the procedural memory in the retriever was last accessed rather than created.

| Memory Type | What is Stored | Human Example              | Agent Example       |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Semantic    | Facts          | Things I learned in school | Facts about a user  |
| Episodic    | Experiences    | Things I did               | Past agent actions  |
| Procedural  | Instructions   | Instincts or motor skills  | Agent system prompt |

#### Architecture Overview

The proposed scoring function contains three types of memory, which are semantic, episodic, and procedural. Similar to human memory system, each memory has its own exponential time decay rate. By assigning a faster decay to episodic memory with slower decays to semantic and procedural memory prioritizes recent student struggles without rapidly discarding current knowledge, which creates more personalized RAG pipelines.
