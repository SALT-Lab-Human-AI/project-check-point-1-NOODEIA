# ACE Implementation Summary (Project-Integrated)

## What Was Delivered

- **ACE core modules** (`ace_memory.py`, `ace_components.py`, `langgraph_agent_ace.py`) copied verbatim from `../ace memory` with the only change being the two syntax fixes (missing `]` in the original solver/learning nodes). All files now live under `frontend/scripts/`.
- **Gemini-backed utility layer** (`langgraph_utile.py`) updated to:
  - Use the Gemini REST API + function calling, replacing the prior OpenAI client.
  - Surface tool call metadata Gemini expects.
  - Run the Neo4j chain with `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.
- **Next.js bridge** (`app/api/ai/chat/route.js`) shell-executes `run_ace_agent.py` so the UI and backend share the same LangGraph+ACE stack.
- **Python runner** (`run_ace_agent.py`) normalises requests, enables ACE learning by default, and emits JSON responses consumed by the API.
- **Documentation & tooling** moved into `setup/` to reflect the new workflow.

## How the Pieces Fit Together

1. UI → `/api/ai/chat` with `{message, conversationHistory}`.
2. Route → spawns `python3 frontend/scripts/run_ace_agent.py` and streams the dialogue as JSON.
3. Runner → loads `build_ace_graph()` from `langgraph_agent_ace.py`.
4. LangGraph → routes, plans, solves with Gemini, and records a trace.
5. ACE pipeline → Reflector + Curator + ACEMemory apply the delta to `ace_memory.json`.
6. JSON response → returned to the browser, including `mode`, `result`, and `scratch.ace_delta`.

## Testing Checklist

| Step | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Install Python deps | `pip3 install -r frontend/requirements.txt` | Includes LangGraph, LangChain, Gemini, MCP, Neo4j, Tavily |
| Export Gemini key | `export GEMINI_API_KEY="sk-..."` | Required for every agent invocation |
| Optional Neo4j vars | `export NEO4J_URI=...` | Needed only if you want the Neo4j tool active |
| CLI sanity check | `python3 frontend/scripts/run_ace_agent.py <<<'{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Help me multiply 8 by 7."}]}'` | Confirms Gemini + ACE can run headless |
| Inspect memory | `cat frontend/scripts/ace_memory.json` | File appears after the first successful run |
| Analyze memory | `python3 frontend/scripts/analyze_ace_memory.py` | Shows bullet counts, categories, scores |
| Start UI (locally) | `npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3001` | The CLI sandbox blocks listening; run on your own machine |

## Key Differences vs. Original Memory

| Feature | Previous implementation | ACE integration |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Memory usage | Write-only transcripts | Structured bullets injected before inference |
| Learning loop | None | Reflector + Curator + incremental deltas |
| Model | OpenAI completion client | Gemini 2.5 function calling |
| Tool routing | Manual (no names) | Adds tool `name` for Gemini compliance |
| UI integration | Standalone script | Wired through `/api/ai/chat` |

## Configuration & Customisation

- Set `ACE_MEMORY_FILE` to point the memory to a different location if you don’t want it in `frontend/scripts/`.
- Disable online learning per request by passing `"ace_online_learning": false` in the `scratch` dictionary (e.g., modify `run_ace_agent.py` payload).
- Tweak the memory parameters (max bullets, dedup/prune thresholds) in `ACEMemory` initialiser if you need a slimmer or more aggressive knowledge base.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY not configured` | Export the key before running piped scripts or the dev server. |
| 500 error from `/api/ai/chat` | Look at the JSON body—`error` contains the structured message from the Python runner. |
| Dev server won’t start (EPERM) | Run Next.js on a system that permits binding to the requested port; the Codex harness blocks it. |
| Memory file missing | It is created on first successful invocation; run the CLI test above. |

With these updates you can freely swap between API, CLI, and automated workflows while keeping the ACE engine, memory growth, and Gemini integration identical to the upstream reference.***
