We received feedback and addressed it in the following ways:

Feedback 1: Add direct links to comparable products
We addressed this point by ensuring all tools and AIs used were properly hyperlinked throughout the project’s README files.

Feedback 2: Explicitly acknowledge AI tool usage
We have added a new section titled [Inspiration and Disclosures](#-Inspiration-and-disclosures) at the bottom of our GitHub repository. This section will be updated throughout the duration of our project, showcasing which AI tools we’ve used, how we’ve used them, and for what specific purpose. 

Feedback 3 and 4: Clarify use case scenarios and mitigate risks of children using AI
After speaking with our relevant stakeholders, we’ve decided it’s best if our AI tutor is used only when the teacher is nearby and watching over the student. This way, the AI’s outputs can be monitored at all times, and the tutor can be most effectively utilized. 

Feedback 5: Add a team collaboration summary
All of our individual contributions are tracked by GitHub and added to the [Contributions](#-contributions) section of this README.
