# NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)

Hart and Staveland’s NASA Task Load Index (TLX) method assesses workload on
six dimensions. Each dimension is rated on a 21-point scale from **Very Low**
to **Very High** (or **Perfect** to **Failure** for Performance).

# NASA-TLX Scoring

### Step 1 – Collect ratings

For each of the six dimensions, record a rating from 0–100  
(you can map the 21 tick marks to 0, 5, 10, …, 100):

- Mental Demand (MD)
- Physical Demand (PD)
- Temporal Demand (TD)
- Performance (PE)  *(note: higher = worse performance)*
- Effort (EF)
- Frustration (FR)

Let these be:

$$(R_{MD}, R_{PD}, R_{TD}, R_{PE}, R_{EF}, R_{FR})$$

---

### Raw (unweighted) TLX score

Just take the average of the six ratings:

$$[\text{Raw TLX} = \frac{R_{MD} + R_{PD} + R_{TD} + R_{PE} + R_{EF} + R_{FR}}{6}]$$

This gives a score from 0 to 100.

# Standard version of the System Usability Scale (SUS)

For each statement, please select a number from **1** to **5**:

- **1** – Strongly disagree  
- **2** – Disagree  
- **3** – Neither agree nor disagree  
- **4** – Agree  
- **5** – Strongly agree  

1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.  
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.  
3. I thought the system was easy to use.  
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.  
5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.  
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.  
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.  
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.  
9. I felt very confident using the system.  
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

# SUS Scale

$$\mathrm{SUS} = 2.5\left(20 + \sum(\mathrm{SUS01},\mathrm{SUS03},\mathrm{SUS05},\mathrm{SUS07},\mathrm{SUS09}) - \sum(\mathrm{SUS02},\mathrm{SUS04},\mathrm{SUS06},\mathrm{SUS08},\mathrm{SUS10})\right)$$

SUS has generally been seen as providing this type of high-level subjective view of usability and is thus often used in carrying out comparisons of usability between systems. Because it yields a single score on a scale of 0–100, it can be used to compare even systems that are outwardly dissimilar. This one-dimensional aspect of the SUS is both a benefit and a drawback because the questionnaire is necessarily quite general.
