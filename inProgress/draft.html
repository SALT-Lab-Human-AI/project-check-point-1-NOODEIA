<p><strong>Mathematical breakdown:</strong> 1. Sum all five ratings: <code>Total = R_MD + R_TD + R_PE + R_EF + R_FR</code> - Minimum possible sum: 0 (all dimensions rated 0) - Maximum possible sum: 500 (all dimensions rated 100)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">

<ul>
<li>If student rates 5 (Strongly agree) → Contribution = 5 - 1 = 4</li>

<p><strong>Negative item:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Contribution = 5 - Raw Score</code></pre>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formula-explanation-1">Formula Explanation</h4>
<p><strong>Why this scoring method?</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Normalizes positive and negative items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive items: Subtract 1 to get range of 0-4</li>
<li>Negative item: Reverse with (5 - score) to get range of 0-4</li>
<li>This ensures all items contribute in the same direction (higher = better)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each item contributes 0-4 points</li>
<li>5 items × 4 points = <strong>20 maximum points</strong></li>
<li>Multiply by 5 to scale to 0-100: <code>20 × 5 = 100</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Example calculation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Student responses:
SUS01 = 5 (Strongly agree - would use frequently)
SUS03 = 4 (Agree - easy to use)
SUS04 = 2 (Disagree - don't need tech support) ✓
SUS07 = 4 (Agree - quick to learn)
SUS09 = 5 (Strongly agree - felt confident)

Contributions:
C_01 = 5 - 1 = 4
C_03 = 4 - 1 = 3
C_04 = 5 - 2 = 3 (reversed!)
C_07 = 4 - 1 = 3
C_09 = 5 - 1 = 4

Total contributions = 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 17

Short SUS = 5 × 17 = 85 (Excellent usability!)</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Result interpretation:</strong> - <strong>0-100 scale</strong> where higher scores indicate <strong>better usability</strong> - Maintains the SUS scale properties for benchmarking</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Administer immediately after a tutoring session (while experience is fresh)</li>
<li>Ideal session length: 20-30 minutes</li>
<li>Allow 5-10 minutes after session for survey completion</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Instructions for Students:</strong></p>
<pre><code>"We want to know about your experience using the AI tutor today. 
There are no right or wrong answers—we just want your honest opinion 
so we can make the tutor better for you and other students.

This should take about 5 minutes. Please answer based on how you 
felt during today's session."</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Response Format:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use visual sliders or click-to-mark scales (more engaging than text boxes)</li>
<li>Show progress indicator (e.g., “Question 3 of 10”)</li>
<li>Allow “skip” option but encourage completion</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous vs.&nbsp;Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anonymous:</strong> Higher honesty, can’t track individual progress</li>
<li><strong>Identified:</strong> Can correlate with performance data, track over time</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use student IDs (pseudo-anonymous) to enable longitudinal analysis while protecting identity</li>
